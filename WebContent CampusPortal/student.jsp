However, such students will be eligible to appear for placements only until the day on which the company (which has offered PPO) visits the campus.</li>
							<li>The offer of PPO (by the company) and its acceptance (by the student) shall be through placement office only.</li>
							<li>Once a student accepts PPO, he / she shall be de-registered from placement.</li>
						</ul>
					</li></p>
					<p><li><b><u>MULTIPLE OFFERS:</u></b>  Each student is eligible for only one job offer.
						<ul>
							<li>If a student receives more than one offer in a session / day and if there is a delay in the announcement of results by some companies, the student is bound to accept the job offer of the company whose results are declared in time.  </li>
							<li>	If the results are declared on the same session / day, the student may choose from the offers in hand and inform the placement office of his/her choice, within 24 hrs of announcement of results.</li>
						</ul>
					</li></p>
					<p><li>Every student who is selected by a company is out of placement thereafter i.e. deregistered from the placement website. </li></p>

The responsibility of going through the offer letter and taking actions therein such as submission of documents lies entirely with the student.

If there is a rejection at this stage, the student registration will be renewed and the student becomes eligible again to seek placement through this office.  Students should go through and understand instructions related to medical test carefully. The same should also be adequately clarified during PPT.</li></p>
